## About the Site
   For 2021 HackDavis event, we at Team Plasma set out to develop a site using OCR (optical character recognition) to extract textual information from images and use it to process user eligibility for
   plasma donations. Our motivations were to contribute in a way that would help tackle the COVID-19
   pandemic, all in the interest of promoting social good across the nation.
